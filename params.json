{"name":"NoMQ","tagline":"Not a Message Queue (but a simple drop-in event queue)","body":"# NoMQ\r\n__NoMQ__ is short for _Not a Message Queue_. It is a distributed event queue that is based on Java 8 and Hazelcast. NoMQ requires\r\n__NO__ installation, simply add the jar to your project.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n* Java 8\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n * __durability:__ events survive reboots\r\n * __late join:__ new nodes can join later on\r\n * __ordering:__ events are delivered in the same order on all nodes\r\n * __no additional installation required:__ simply include the jars and configure NoMQ from within your Java-code.\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\nIf you want to subscribe for events in the NoMQ cluster you need to register an _EventSubscriber_. The following code starts a\r\nNoMQ instance and registers an event subscriber that simply echoes the event id on System.out. Events can be published by any\r\nnode in the cluster, they will arrive at all event subscribers in the same order.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nNoMQ noMQ = NoMQBuilder.builder()               // Obtain a reference to the builder\r\n    .subscribe(e -> System.out.println(e.id())) // Register a subscriber that echoes the id\r\n    .subscribe(e -> doSomethingWithEvent(e))    // Register another subscriber that does something with the event\r\n    .build()                                    // Build the NoMQ-instance\r\n    .start();                                   // Start it (enable publish and subscribe)\r\n\r\n// Publish an event\r\nnoMQ.publish(\"Some payload\".getBytes());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe event interface is pretty straightforward, it contains a generated unique id together with the payload provided by the\r\npublisher of the event.\r\n```java\r\npublic interface Event {\r\n    String id();\r\n    byte[] payload();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _EventSubscribers: simply implements the method _onEvent_.\r\n```java\r\npublic interface EventSubscriber {\r\n    void onEvent(Event event);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuring the cluster\r\nNoMQ is based on Hazelcast - to set up a cluster follow the instructions on the Hazelcast website\r\n(http://hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#network-configuration)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-50620574-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
